## What I Learned  
This project helped me improve my **React** skills, particularly in **state management**, **props**, and **API integration**. I learned how to fetch data from the **Giphy API**, display it dynamically, and manage the app's state efficiently. I also strengthened my skills in **styling** using **CSS**.

## Ongoing Development  
I plan to enhance the app by adding features like **favorite GIFs**, **pagination**, and **more advanced search options**. Additionally, I aim to optimize performance and improve **UI/UX**.
